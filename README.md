# SpotifyRPC
Sets your Discord presence to your Spotify song, without having to link your account.

This is especially useful for when you're listening in offline mode, or can't link your account for some reason (both of which is the case for me).

No downloadable releases yet, if you have .net installed and want to test it feel free to clone.
